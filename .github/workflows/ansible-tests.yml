# This workflow has been split into multiple smaller workflows for better maintainability.
# Please use the main workflow dispatcher: ansible-tests-main.yml
# Individual workflows:
# - lint-and-syntax.yml: YAML/Ansible linting and syntax validation
# - unit-tests.yml: Unit test execution
# - integration-tests.yml: Integration and check mode tests
# - security-scan.yml: Security scanning and validation
# - mock-device-tests.yml: Mock device framework testing
# - molecule-tests.yml: Molecule container testing
# - comprehensive-tests.yml: Critical gap and comprehensive test suites
