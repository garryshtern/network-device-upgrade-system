# Common Role Handlers
# Handlers for deferred actions triggered by 'notify'
#
# NOTE: For immediate state updates (validation results, rollback state),
# use reusable task files instead:
#   - common/tasks/record-validation-result.yml
#   - common/tasks/update-rollback-step.yml
#
# Handlers are appropriate for:
#   - Service restarts
#   - Cleanup operations
#   - Log rotations
#   - Notification delivery

# Currently no handlers defined - use include_tasks for repeated patterns
