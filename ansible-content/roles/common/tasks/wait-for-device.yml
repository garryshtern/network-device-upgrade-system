# Wait for Device Connection
# Reusable task for waiting for device connectivity
#
# Required variables:
#   wait_timeout: Maximum time to wait in seconds
#
# Optional variables (defaults in roles/common/defaults/main.yml):
#   wait_delay: Seconds to wait before starting checks (default: 5)
#   wait_sleep: Seconds between retries (default: 5)
#   connection_check_failed_when: Override failure condition (default: not set)
#   connection_check_when: Additional conditional (default: true)
