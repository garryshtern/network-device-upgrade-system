# DEPRECATED: This playbook is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

# Please use main-upgrade-workflow.yml with tags instead:
#   ansible-playbook ansible-content/playbooks/main-upgrade-workflow.yml --tags step1 \
#     --extra-vars "target_hosts=mydevice max_concurrent=5"
#
# This provides the same functionality with automatic dependency resolution.
