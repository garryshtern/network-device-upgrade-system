# STEP 5: Config Backup and Pre-Upgrade Validation
# 1. Backup current running configuration
# 2. Gather network resources and validate connectivity/state
# Comprehensive validation: BGP, interfaces, routing, etc.
# MUST PASS or workflow STOPS
# Dependencies: STEP 1, STEP 4 (image must be uploaded first)
