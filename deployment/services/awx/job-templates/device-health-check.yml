# AWX Job Template: Device Health Check
# Pre-upgrade validation and baseline capture
#
# DEPRECATED: This job template uses health-check.yml which is deprecated.
# Consider using main-upgrade-workflow.yml with --tags step1 instead.
# This provides automatic dependency resolution and better integration.
