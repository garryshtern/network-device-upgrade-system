Review PR for comprehensive test coverage:

1. Analyze changed files and identify testing needs:
   - New functions/methods require unit tests
   - New features require integration tests
   - API changes require contract tests
   - UI changes require visual/interaction tests

2. Check if existing tests still pass and provide value
3. Suggest additional test scenarios based on the changes
4. Verify CI/CD will catch potential issues
5. Recommend any testing infrastructure improvements

Provide specific, actionable feedback with code examples.
