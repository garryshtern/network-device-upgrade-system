Analyze our test coverage and identify critical gaps:

1. Map all source code to existing tests
2. Run coverage reports and identify untested paths
3. Check for missing integration and e2e tests
4. Identify security and performance testing gaps
5. Suggest 5 highest-priority missing tests
6. Create sample test cases for the most critical gaps

Focus on actionable recommendations with business impact assessment.
