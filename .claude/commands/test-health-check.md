Regular test health assessment:

1. Run all test suites and check for:
   - Flaky tests that sometimes fail
   - Tests that take too long to run
   - Tests that don't provide value
   - Missing tests for recent code changes

2. Review recent code changes for test coverage
3. Check if CI/CD workflows are optimal
4. Identify technical debt in test code
5. Suggest improvements for faster feedback loops

Focus on maintaining high-quality, fast, and reliable test suite.
