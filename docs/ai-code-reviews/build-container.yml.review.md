## Specific Issues and Suggestions

### Line-by-Line Analysis

**Lines 4-8**: Concurrency control commented out
```yaml
# Concurrency control disabled for workflow_call to prevent deadlocks with calling workflows
# concurrency:
#   group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
#   cancel-in-progress: true
```
- **Assessment**: Good decision with clear reasoning
- **Suggestion**: Consider documenting alternative concurrency strategies

**Lines 79-83**: Matrix strategy simplified to AMD64 only
```yaml
matrix:
  platform:
    - name: "AMD64"
      platforms: "linux/amd64"
      suffix: "amd64"
      primary: true
```
- **Strength**: Performance-optimized decision
- **Note**: Comments suggest this was a deliberate optimization from multi-platform
- **Assessment**: Good balance of performance vs. features

**Lines 169-170**: SBOM and provenance disabled
```yaml
provenance: false
sbom: false
```
- **Issue**: Disables built-in security features
- **Justification**: Custom SBOM generation implemented separately (lines 221-234)
- **Assessment**: Acceptable with explicit custom implementation

**Lines 248-251**: Cross-platform execution handling
```bash
if [[ "${{ matrix.platform.platforms }}" == "linux/arm64" ]]; then
  echo "⚠️  Skipping direct execution testing for ARM64 on AMD64 host"
```
- **Excellent**: Proper handling of cross-platform limitations
- **Strength**: Clear documentation of why tests are skipped

**Lines 358-367**: Dynamic repository version handling
```bash
UBUNTU_VERSION=$(lsb_release -rs)
if [ "$UBUNTU_VERSION" = "24.04" ]; then
  REPO_VERSION="22.04"
```
- **Excellent**: Smart handling of repository compatibility
- **Strength**: Future-proofing for new Ubuntu versions
