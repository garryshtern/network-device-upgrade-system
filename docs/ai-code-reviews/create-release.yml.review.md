## Specific Issues and Suggestions

### Line-by-Line Analysis

**Lines 30-35**: Permissions scope
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
  issues: read      # May not be needed
  checks: read      # May not be needed
  pull-requests: read  # May not be needed
  packages: write
```
- **Issue**: Some permissions may be unnecessary for this workflow
- **Fix**: Review and remove unused permissions for better security

**Lines 68-94**: Version calculation logic
```bash
if [ -n "${{ github.event.inputs.custom_version }}" ]; then
  # Custom version handling
else
  # Auto-increment logic
fi
```
- **Strength**: Good conditional logic for version handling
- **Suggestion**: Add validation for custom version format (semantic versioning)

**Lines 125**: Previous tag retrieval
```bash
previous_tag=$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0 HEAD^ 2>/dev/null || echo "")
```
- **Issue**: `HEAD^` may not exist for first release
- **Risk**: Could cause unexpected behavior
- **Fix**: Add better fallback handling

**Lines 228-242**: Container tagging logic
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:latest
docker tag ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:latest \
  ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:${{ needs.create-release.outputs.new_version }}
```
- **Issue**: No verification that the latest image exists
- **Risk**: Could fail if no container was built
- **Fix**: Add image existence check

**Lines 111-122**: Release notes heredoc
```bash
cat > release_notes.md << 'EOF'
${{ github.event.inputs.release_notes }}
EOF
```
- **Issue**: User input directly embedded in heredoc
- **Risk**: Potential injection if input contains special characters
- **Fix**: Add input sanitization or use safer method

### Critical Issues

#### 1. Input Validation and Sanitization
- **Location**: Lines 111-122, 68-73
- **Risk**: Medium - potential injection or malformed input
- **Fix**: Add comprehensive input validation and sanitization

#### 2. Container Image Existence Validation
- **Location**: Lines 228-242
- **Risk**: Medium - workflow could fail if referenced image doesn't exist
- **Fix**: Add image existence verification before tagging

#### 3. Rollback Mechanism
- **Location**: Overall workflow design
- **Risk**: Medium - partial failures could leave repository in inconsistent state
- **Fix**: Implement proper rollback for failed releases

### Enhancement Opportunities
