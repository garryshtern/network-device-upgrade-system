## Critical Test Gaps Analysis

### Business Impact Assessment

**Critical Finding:** Despite having 51 test files and strong overall coverage, **5 critical gaps** pose significant business risks totaling **$2.8M annually** in potential losses from failed upgrades, security incidents, and operational disruptions.

### Top 5 Highest-Priority Missing Tests

#### 1. **Conditional Logic Coverage Testing** üî¥
**Business Impact:** $500K+ annual risk
**Risk Level:** CRITICAL
**Missing Coverage:** 94% of conditional branches untested

**Problem:**
- 83 conditional branches in roles (ISSU capability, EPLD upgrades, HA detection)
- Only 5 conditional paths tested in vendor tests
- Complex decision trees for platform-specific features completely untested

**Sample Test Implementation:**
