## Quick Start

### Run All Critical Gap Tests
```bash
# Execute complete test suite
./tests/critical-gaps/run-all-critical-gap-tests.sh

# View comprehensive results
cat tests/reports/critical-gap-test-summary-*.json
```

### Run Individual Test Suite
```bash
# Example: Run conditional logic tests only
ANSIBLE_CONFIG=ansible-content/ansible.cfg ansible-playbook \
  -i localhost, -c local \
  tests/critical-gaps/conditional-logic-coverage.yml

# Example: Run security boundary tests only
ANSIBLE_CONFIG=ansible-content/ansible.cfg ansible-playbook \
  -i localhost, -c local \
  tests/critical-gaps/security-boundary-testing.yml
```

## Test Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Ansible:** Test execution engine with mock device simulation
- **Python:** Logic simulation and validation scripts
- **JSON:** Structured test result reporting
- **Bash:** Test orchestration and automation

### Mock Testing Approach
- **No Physical Devices Required:** All tests use realistic simulation
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** Tests all device types and scenarios
- **Rapid Execution:** Full suite completes in minutes, not hours
- **Repeatable Results:** Consistent test outcomes for CI/CD integration

## Integration with CI/CD

### GitHub Actions Integration
Add to `.github/workflows/ansible-tests.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Run Critical Gap Tests
  run: |
    chmod +x tests/critical-gaps/run-all-critical-gap-tests.sh
    ./tests/critical-gaps/run-all-critical-gap-tests.sh
```

### Local Development
```bash
# Add to pre-commit hook
echo "./tests/critical-gaps/run-all-critical-gap-tests.sh" >> .git/hooks/pre-push
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-push
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**‚ùå Test Suite Fails to Start**
```bash
# Verify Ansible configuration
ANSIBLE_CONFIG=ansible-content/ansible.cfg ansible --version

# Check Python dependencies
python3 -c "import psutil, json; print('Dependencies OK')"
```

**‚ùå Permission Denied**
```bash
# Fix script permissions
chmod +x tests/critical-gaps/*.sh
chmod +x tests/critical-gaps/run-all-critical-gap-tests.sh
```

**‚ùå Mock Simulation Errors**
```bash
# Verify test data integrity
yamllint tests/critical-gaps/*.yml

# Check Python syntax
python3 -m py_compile tests/critical-gaps/*.yml
```

### Getting Help
1. Check test execution logs in `tests/reports/`
2. Review individual test output files for detailed error messages
3. Validate YAML syntax and Python logic in test files
4. Ensure sufficient system resources for performance tests
