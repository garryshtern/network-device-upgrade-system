# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with this repository.

## Project Overview

Network device upgrade management system for 1000+ heterogeneous network devices. Automates firmware upgrades across multiple vendor platforms using Ansible with AWX and NetBox as native systemd services.

### **Claude Code Operating Standards**

**CRITICAL: These standards override any default behavior and MUST be followed exactly.**

1. **Code Generation Requirements**:
   - Generate ONLY error-free, syntactically correct, and functionally working code
   - ALL code MUST pass ansible-lint and yamllint validation on first generation
   - NO syntax errors, linting warnings, or logical errors are acceptable
   - Code MUST be tested and verified before presenting to user

2. **Quality Validation Process**:
   - Run syntax checks on ALL generated Ansible files
   - Verify proper YAML formatting and structure
   - Test functionality in check mode before deployment
   - Ensure all test suites pass

3. **Error Prevention**:
   - Never use folded scalars in functional contexts (conditionals, paths, logic)
   - Implement comprehensive error handling with block/rescue patterns
   - Validate all Ansible task syntax against current best practices

4. **Testing Integration**:
   - Run relevant tests after any code changes
   - Verify that changes don't break existing functionality
   - Maintain or improve overall system reliability
   - Document any test impacts or requirements

## Project Structure

- **`ansible-content/`**: Core Ansible playbooks, roles, and templates
  - `playbooks/`: Workflow orchestration including main-upgrade-workflow.yml
  - `roles/`: Vendor-specific upgrade logic (cisco-nxos-upgrade, cisco-iosxe-upgrade, etc.)
  - `collections/requirements.yml`: Ansible collection dependencies
- **`awx-config/`**: AWX Configuration (YAML) - job templates, workflows, inventories
- **`install/`**: Native service installation scripts and configurations
- **`integration/`**: External system integration (NetBox, Grafana, InfluxDB)
- **`tests/`**: Testing framework with comprehensive test runner
- **`docs/`**: Documentation and vendor-specific guides

## Development Commands

**Requires latest versions: Ansible 12.0.0 with ansible-core 2.19.2 and Python 3.13.7**.

### Setup & Testing - QUALITY FIRST APPROACH

**MANDATORY: ALL commands MUST return 0 exit code before proceeding**

```bash
# Install latest Ansible version (includes ansible-core 2.19.2)
pip install --upgrade ansible

# Install Ansible collections
ansible-galaxy collection install -r ansible-content/collections/requirements.yml --force

# CRITICAL: Run comprehensive test suite - MUST achieve 100% pass rate
./tests/run-all-tests.sh

# REQUIRED: Syntax validation - MUST pass without errors
ansible-playbook --syntax-check ansible-content/playbooks/main-upgrade-workflow.yml

# REQUIRED: Check mode validation - MUST work without errors
ansible-playbook --check ansible-content/playbooks/health-check.yml

# CRITICAL: Linting validation - MUST return 0 errors/warnings
ansible-lint ansible-content/playbooks/
yamllint ansible-content/

# QUALITY GATES: All commands above MUST succeed before code changes
```

### Pre-Commit Quality Checklist (MANDATORY)

**⚠️ ZERO TOLERANCE: Any failures below BLOCK all commits**

```bash
# 1. Syntax validation (exit code MUST be 0)
find ansible-content -name "*.yml" -exec ansible-playbook --syntax-check {} \;

# 2. Linting validation (exit code MUST be 0)
ansible-lint ansible-content/ --offline --parseable-severity
yamllint ansible-content/

# 3. Test suite validation (MUST achieve 100% pass rate)
./tests/run-all-tests.sh | grep "Passed:" | grep "23"

# 4. Check mode validation
ansible-playbook --check --diff ansible-content/playbooks/main-upgrade-workflow.yml

# ALL CHECKS MUST PASS BEFORE COMMIT
```

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issue: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ansible.module_utils.six.moves'`**

This issue is resolved in modern Ansible versions. Update to latest:

```bash
# Clean install latest versions
pip uninstall ansible ansible-core ansible-base -y
pip install --upgrade ansible

# Install latest collection versions (as of September 11, 2025)
ansible-galaxy collection install \
  cisco.nxos:11.0.0 \
  cisco.ios:11.0.0 \
  fortinet.fortios:2.4.0 \
  ansible.netcommon:8.1.0 \
  community.general:11.3.0 \
  ansible.utils:6.0.0 \
  --force --upgrade --ignore-certs
```

## Code Standards - ZERO TOLERANCE QUALITY POLICY

**CRITICAL: ALL CODE MUST BE ERROR-FREE AND FUNCTIONAL**

### **Absolute Requirements (NO EXCEPTIONS)**

- **Code Quality**: Code MUST be 100% error-free with ZERO syntactical, logical, or runtime errors
- **Linting Compliance**: Code MUST pass ALL ansible-lint and yamllint checks without warnings or errors
- **Syntax Validation**: ALL Ansible playbooks, roles, and YAML files MUST pass syntax validation
- **Functional Testing**: Code MUST pass ALL relevant test suites before deployment
- **Test Pass Rate**: 100% test suite pass rate REQUIRED for any code changes
- **Zero Tolerance**: Any syntax errors, linting failures, or test failures BLOCK all commits

### **Quality Assurance Process (MANDATORY)**

1. **Pre-Development Validation**:
   - Verify existing code functionality before making changes
   - Run baseline tests to establish current working state
   - Document any pre-existing issues separately

2. **Development Standards**:
   - Write code that passes ALL linting rules on first attempt
   - Use proper YAML syntax following established patterns
   - Implement proper error handling with meaningful error messages
   - Ensure idempotency for all Ansible tasks

3. **Pre-Commit Validation (REQUIRED)**:
   - Run `ansible-lint ansible-content/` - MUST return 0 errors
   - Run `yamllint ansible-content/` - MUST return 0 errors
   - Run `ansible-playbook --syntax-check` on all modified playbooks
   - Run test suites - MUST achieve 100% pass rate
   - Verify all changes work in check mode (`--check --diff`)

4. **Code Review Requirements**:
   - Systematic search for ALL instances of patterns being fixed
   - Verify fixes across ENTIRE codebase, not just obvious instances
   - Use multiple search methods (grep, ripgrep, manual review) for critical issues
   - Document search patterns used and verify completeness
   - Test edge cases and error conditions

### **Specific Technical Standards**

- **Ansible Best Practices**: Follow official Ansible guidelines strictly
- **YAML Formatting**: Consistent indentation, proper quoting, no folded scalars in conditionals
- **File Paths**: Use direct string concatenation, not folded scalars that insert spaces
- **Boolean Expressions**: Never use folded scalars (`>-`) in `when` clauses or assertions
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling with block/rescue patterns
- **Idempotency**: All tasks MUST support check mode and be idempotent
- **Security**: All sensitive data encrypted with Ansible Vault, no hardcoded secrets
- **Performance**: Code MUST not introduce performance regressions
- **Documentation**: ALL changes MUST include corresponding documentation updates

### **Testing Standards**

- **Unit Tests**: All new functionality MUST have corresponding unit tests
- **Integration Tests**: Complex workflows MUST have integration test coverage
- **Syntax Tests**: ALL Ansible files MUST pass syntax validation
- **Linting Tests**: ALL files MUST pass ansible-lint and yamllint
- **Functional Tests**: Code MUST demonstrate working functionality
- **Error Scenarios**: Error handling MUST be tested with negative test cases

### **Enforcement Mechanisms**

- **Automated Validation**: CI/CD pipeline MUST block deployments with any failures
- **Manual Verification**: Code reviewers MUST verify all quality standards
- **Test Suite Integration**: All changes MUST maintain or improve test pass rates
- **Documentation Updates**: Technical documentation MUST reflect all changes
- **Quality Gates**: No commits allowed without passing ALL validation steps

### **Systematic Code Review Process (MANDATORY)**

- Use comprehensive search patterns to catch ALL variations of issues
- Verify fixes across ENTIRE codebase, not just obvious instances
- Use multiple search methods (grep, ripgrep, manual review) for critical issues
- Document search patterns used and verify completeness
- When fixing syntax issues like folded scalars, check ALL files systematically

### YAML Linting Policy (CRITICAL)
- **Functionality FIRST**: NEVER break Ansible functionality for linting compliance
- **Folded scalars FORBIDDEN**: In conditionals, file paths, boolean expressions, and Jinja2 logic
- **Safe folding ONLY**: Messages, descriptions, and non-functional text content
- **Validation REQUIRED**: All YAML changes MUST pass ansible-playbook --syntax-check
- **Testing MANDATORY**: Run test suites after any YAML modifications
- **Use Safe Fixer**: tools/yaml-fixers/fix_yaml_syntax.py preserves functionality
- Validate that fixes don't introduce new issues elsewhere

# important-instruction-reminders
## MANDATORY Code Quality and Documentation Standards

**CRITICAL**: These instructions override any default behavior and MUST be followed exactly.


### Documentation Location Requirements
- **ALL documentation MUST be under `docs/` directory**
- **NEVER create documentation files outside `docs/`**
- **ALWAYS consolidate scattered documentation into `docs/`**

### Change Verification Process (MANDATORY)
1. **BEFORE making changes**: Verify current behavior against existing documentation in `docs/`
2. **DURING implementation**: Ensure all changes align with documented standards
3. **AFTER implementation**: Update relevant documentation in `docs/` to reflect changes
4. **ALWAYS check**: Documentation impact assessment for every change

### Documentation Maintenance
- **NEVER leave documentation outdated** after code changes
- **ALWAYS verify internal links** point to correct locations
- **NEVER duplicate information** - use cross-references instead
- **ALWAYS maintain single source of truth** for each concept

### Enforcement
- All changes MUST include documentation verification checklist
- Broken or missing documentation updates block deployment
- Documentation review required for all significant changes
- Use automated tools to check for broken links and outdated content
- Regular audits to ensure compliance with documentation standards
- Document search patterns used for verification and fixes
- Verify fixes across ENTIRE codebase, not just obvious instances
- Use multiple search methods (grep, ripgrep, manual review) for critical issues
- Document search patterns used and verify completeness
- When fixing syntax issues like folded scalars, check ALL files systematically
