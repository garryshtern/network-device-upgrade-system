- **Lines 86-96**: Warning thresholds could be configurable parameters
- Missing validation of write permissions for log directory

### 🟡 Documentation Opportunities  
- Script header could include usage examples
- Missing parameter documentation for configuration variables
- Could benefit from inline comments for complex version detection logic

## Security Assessment

### 🟢 Excellent Security Practices
- **Lines 36-39**: Proper privilege validation requiring root access
- **Line 7**: Strict error handling prevents undefined behavior
- **Lines 10-11**: Safe path resolution avoiding potential injection
- **Lines 24-25**: Proper directory creation with secure permissions

### 🟡 Security Enhancements (Minor)
- Could validate log file permissions after creation
- Missing validation of environment variable safety

## Performance Assessment

### 🟢 Efficient Implementation
- **Lines 85-98**: Efficient system resource detection
- **Lines 54-66**: Optimized OS detection with early returns
- Minimal external command usage for better performance

## Code Quality Analysis

### 🟢 Professional Standards
- Consistent naming conventions throughout
- Proper function organization and separation
- Clear variable scoping and usage
- Professional error messaging

### 🟢 Maintainability
- **Lines 10-14**: Configuration section clearly separated
- **Lines 42-78**: Modular OS detection function
- **Lines 81-99**: Reusable resource validation function
- Well-structured with logical flow

## Recommendations for Minor Improvements

### 1. **Make Paths Configurable** (Priority: Low)
```bash
# Add environment variable support:
LOG_DIR="${LOG_DIR:-/var/log/network-upgrade}"
DATA_DIR="${DATA_DIR:-/opt/network-upgrade}"
```

### 2. **Add Usage Documentation** (Priority: Low)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Network Device Upgrade Management System - Base System Installation
# Usage: sudo ./install-system.sh [--log-dir /custom/log/path]
# Requirements: Root privileges, RHEL/CentOS 8+ or Ubuntu 20.04+
```

### 3. **Enhance Log Directory Security** (Priority: Medium)
```bash
# After line 24:
chmod 750 "${LOG_DIR}"
chown root:adm "${LOG_DIR}" 2>/dev/null || true
```

### 4. **Add Configuration Validation** (Priority: Low)
```bash
validate_config() {
    [[ -w $(dirname "${LOG_DIR}") ]] || error_exit "Cannot write to log directory parent"
    [[ -w $(dirname "${DATA_DIR}") ]] || error_exit "Cannot write to data directory parent"
}
```
