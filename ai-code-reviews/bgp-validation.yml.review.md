- **Lines 160-166**: Statistical calculations could benefit from formula comments
- **Line 196**: Magic number (10%) should be configurable

### 🟡 Security Considerations
- **Line 244**: InfluxDB token should be validated before use
- **Lines 124, 152**: File paths should be validated for directory traversal

## Recommendations for Minor Improvements

### 1. **Extract Complex Jinja2 Logic** (Priority: Low)
```yaml
# Create filter plugin: plugins/filter/bgp_parser.py
- name: Parse BGP neighbor states
  ansible.builtin.set_fact:
    bgp_neighbors: "{{ bgp_summary_raw.stdout[0] | bgp_neighbors_parser }}"
```

### 2. **Make Thresholds Configurable** (Priority: Low)  
```yaml
# In defaults/main.yml
bgp_validation:
  prefix_variance_threshold: 10  # percentage
  convergence_timeout: 300       # seconds
```

### 3. **Add Path Validation** (Priority: Medium)
```yaml
- name: Validate baseline directory
  ansible.builtin.file:
    path: "/var/log/network-upgrade/baselines"
    state: directory
    mode: '0750'
  delegate_to: localhost
```

### 4. **Optimize Batch Operations** (Priority: Low)
```yaml
# Use single command with multiple neighbors:
commands: 
  - "show bgp all neighbors received-routes summary | include {{ bgp_neighbors | map(attribute='neighbor_ip') | join('|') }}"
```

## Advanced Features Worth Highlighting
